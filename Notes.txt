Personal Notes:
- API stopped working close to a year. Steps to take:
  1. Make note of Spotify border color in README.md
  2. Make note of Spotify bar color in templates > themes > dark in forked repository
  3. Delete current Spotify API 
  4. Delete novatorem project in Vercel
  6. Delete current forked repository
  7. Re-add novatorem repository
  8. Follow YouTube video and set up entirely new project and API
  9. Replace domain url in README.md
